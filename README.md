# MyDashLight

A kitchen touchscreen family hub, like Skylight but built around how our family actually runs:
rides, chores, lunches and the calendar, shown so you only see what needs attention now.

Home Assistant runs the backend. Google Calendar is where the family's data lives, so there is no
separate database or server to look after.

## What's here

`custom_components/mydashlight` is a custom Home Assistant integration. This first version has the
rides planner and the event-notes format, with setup and options screens. Google Calendar sync,
travel times, the week's plan for the kitchen app, and reminders come next.

| Module | Job |
| --- | --- |
| `planner.py` | Works out each parent's driving for a day: the route, leave-by times, problems (late, kid waiting, clashes with a parent's calendar, no driver) and the best fixes for each. |
| `board.py` | Everything the ride board shows for a day: who is in which car, double-bookings, each driver's outings as a list of stops, and the ride line on each activity card. |
| `notes.py` | Reads and writes ride details in a Google Calendar event's notes. |
| `settings.py` | Turns the integration's options into planner and notes settings. |
| `config_flow.py` | The setup and options screens. |

`planner.py`, `board.py`, `notes.py` and `settings.py` don't import Home Assistant, so they can be
tested and reused on their own.

## Ride details in event notes

Each kid's activity is an event on their own Google calendar. Ride details go in a block at the
end of the event's notes, after a `--- Rides ---` line:

```
Bring shin guards. Field 3.

--- Rides ---
Drop-off: Sam
Pick-up: the Parkers
Stay: yes
Arrive by: 5:15 PM
Travel: 25 min
```

| Line | Values | Without the line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drop-off, Pick-up | A parent's name or another name they go by, Not needed, or anyone else's name (a carpool driver) | Nobody is driving yet, which shows as a problem |
| Stay | yes | The driver drops off and comes back. Stay only applies when one parent drives both ways |
| Arrive by | A time, such as 5:15 PM, or 15 min early | Arrive 5 minutes before the start |
| Travel | Minutes, such as 25 min | Use the computed drive time |

Labels ignore case, spaces and hyphens, so `Drop off`, `Dropoff` and `Pickup` all work. Only lines
inside the block count, so a note like "Pick-up: bring cleats" higher up is never read as a driver.
If the notes have no block yet, ride lines anywhere count, so a quick line typed on a phone works,
and the app moves them into a block the next time it changes the ride. The app only ever changes
the block. Everything else in the notes stays as it was, in plain text or in the HTML Google uses
once someone edits notes on the web.

## Development

Needs Python 3.13 or 3.14 (Home Assistant OS runs 3.14) and, for the reference checks, Node 22.

```sh
python3.13 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pytest
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy
```

The planner is a port of the one in the ride board mockup. `tests/rides_reference` holds that
original, golden results for ten days, and a script that runs it; see the README there.

## Installing in Home Assistant

With [HACS](https://hacs.xyz): open HACS, choose **Custom repositories** from the menu, add
`https://github.com/mobrien118/MyDashLight` as an **Integration**, then download **MyDashLight**.

By hand: copy `custom_components/mydashlight` into the `custom_components` folder of your Home
Assistant config.

Then restart Home Assistant and add **MyDashLight** under Settings > Devices & services.
